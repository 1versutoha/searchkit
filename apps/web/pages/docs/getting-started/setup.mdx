title: Quick Start with Searchkit

## Quick Start

For this quick start, we are going to run Elasticsearch locally and build a small e-commerce search experience using Searchkit and instantsearch.

### Running Elasticsearch

<Callout type="info">
  This quick start will need CORS enabled as we will be calling Elasticsearch / Opensearch directly from the browser. See <a href="/docs/guides/enable-cors" className="text-blue-600 underline">Enable CORS</a> to do this
</Callout> 

Going to use Elasticsearch via Docker for this quick start. 

For other options, see [Setup Elasticsearch](/docs/guides/setup-elasticsearch).

Below we are running Elasticsearch with CORS enabled and security disabled. For production, you should enable security and use an API key. See [Setup Elasticsearch](/docs/guides/setup-elasticsearch) for more ways of connecting with authentication.

```bash
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.6.2
docker network create elastic
docker run --name elasticsearch --net elastic -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" -e http.cors.enabled=true -e "http.cors.allow-origin='*'" -e http.cors.allow-headers=X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type,Content-Length,Authorization -e http.cors.allow-credentials=true -e network.publish_host=localhost -e xpack.security.enabled=false docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.6.2
```

### Create an Index & index some data

Our data model will have the following structure:

- A `products` has many `product` documents
- Each `product` document has a `name`, `price`, `description` and `categories` attributes

Lets create an index called `products` and add some data.

```bash
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:9200/products' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "description": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "price": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "categories": {
        "type": "text",
        "fields": {
          "keyword": {
            "type": "keyword"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Now lets add some data to our index.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9200/products/_doc' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "name": "Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max",
  "description": "The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the most powerful iPhone ever. It has a 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display, a Ceramic Shield front cover, and a triple-camera system with a LiDAR scanner. It also has a 5G connection, a 6-core CPU, and a 4-core GPU. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is available in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage options.",
  "categories": ["phones", "apple"],
  "price": 800
}'

curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9200/products/_doc' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "name": "Apple iPhone 12 Pro",
  "description": "The iPhone 12 Pro is the most powerful iPhone ever. It has a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display, a Ceramic Shield front cover, and a triple-camera system with a LiDAR scanner. It also has a 5G connection, a 6-core CPU, and a 4-core GPU. The iPhone 12 Pro is available in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage options.",
  "categories": ["phones", "apple"],
  "price": 700
}'
```
