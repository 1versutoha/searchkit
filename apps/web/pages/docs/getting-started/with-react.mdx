### Building the Frontend

Add the following code to your React app:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Client from "@searchkit/instantsearch-client";
import Searchkit from "searchkit";
import { InstantSearch, SearchBox, Hits, RefinementList } from "react-instantsearch-dom";

// Create a Searchkit client
// This is the configuration for Searchkit, specifying the fields to attributes used for search, facets, etc.
const sk = new Searchkit({
  connection: {
    host: "http://localhost:9200",
  },
  search_settings: {
    highlight_attributes: ["name"],
    snippet_attributes: ["description"],
    search_attributes: [{ field: "name", weight: 3 }, "description", "categories"],
    result_attributes: ["name", "description", "price", "categories"],
    facet_attributes: [{
      field: "categories.keyword",
      type: "string",
      attribute: "categories",
    }, {
      field: "price",
      type: "numeric",
      attribute: "price",
    }],
  },
})

const searchClient = Client(sk);

const App = () => (
  <InstantSearch indexName="bestbuy" searchClient={searchClient}>
    <SearchBox />
    <RefinementList attribute="categories" />
    <Hits />
  </InstantSearch>
);

export default App;
```

## Adding Refinements

Refinements provide your users with a way to narrow down their search results. 

See the [Refinements](/docs/components/refinements/refinement-list) to add refinements to your search.

## Customising the UI

TODO - contributions welcome

## Query Rules

Query rules allow you to customize the search results based on the user's query.

Follow the [query rules guide](/docs//query-rules) to add query rules to your search.

## Deploying to Production

If you're using Next.js, you can deploy your app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with a single click. If you're using Cloudflare workers, you can deploy your app through Cloudflare wrangler on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com).
