### Indexing sample data used for Demos

The sample data used for the demos is available in the `sample-data` directory. 

To index the sample data, follow the steps below:

1. go to the folder dataset. For example `mrp-products`
2. update the `index.ts` file with the correct credentials to index
3. The script will add a new index with the mappings in `mappings.json` and index the data in `data.json`
